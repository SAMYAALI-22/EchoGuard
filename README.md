## 🧠 What is EchoGuard?

**EchoGuard** is a sweet little emotional support system I built with ❤️ at **AlgoArena 2025**.

It takes your words and gently checks:
- How you're feeling (happy? sad? anxious?)
- Whether you might need help (like in a crisis)
- Then quietly saves it, and if it’s urgent... it alerts someone 💬

All of this is done with:
- 💻 A friendly Python Flask backend  
- 🌐 A cute little HTML+JS frontend  
- 🚨 Crisis alert simulation (no real SMS yet!)  
- 🗃️ Local JSON “diary” of emotions
